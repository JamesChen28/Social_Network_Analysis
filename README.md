## WHAT is Social Network
Social network consists of **Nodes** and **Edges**. Nodes represent people or companies and Edges represent the relationships among these people or companies. Besides, the most important thing in social network analysis is calculating **Centrality**. Centrality highlight important nodes in social network.

* Nodes

  Nodes are entities. For example, people such as teachers and students, can be viewed as nodes. Nodes have attributes, like age, gender and height. Then what are the relationships between teachers and teachers, teachers and students, studets and student? We must use edges to show the relationships.

* Edges

  Edges are relationships between two nodes.

* Centrality

## HOW to Use Social Network Analysis
Here, I list some tools to demonstrate social network analysis, including python, Gephi and neo4j. You should choose right tool based on your purpose.

* Python

  In python, we use **networkx** to analyze social network. **networkx** can draw the social network graph and calculate degree. This is an useful package to analyze. However, to demonstrate the final graph of social network, we should combine **matplotlib**, which makes the graph non-interactive. It means that it is difficult to change and tune the social network layout.

  If you have few nodes and edges, python is a great weapon to show social network. But if you have lots of nodes and edges, and also want interactive social network graph, then you should choose other tools.

* Gephi

  Gephi is a visualization software that can analyze social network.

* neo4j
  Similar to Gephi, neo4j can also visualize social network.
